# Data-Exploration-in-SQL
## Overview

This project reveal my step by step aproach in data exploration. We have two dataset, one with covid deaths and one with vactinations.
This two are compared directly to see if we gain some insights, like the global numbers of total deaths vs population, or vaccinated vs population, or breaking things into continents to see which country are performing well in this scenario and which are performing worst, etc.
## Tehnical stuff
For this exploration I used Microsoft SQL Server because this sets are quite large and I pulled different types of data, so SQL to me was the natural option in this scenario.
